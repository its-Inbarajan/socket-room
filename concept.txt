User info - name

- two users will join the socket by name and userId
- if two users are idle and connected on the socket, then create a room and send room details and other user details to them via socket
- if any user wants to leave the room then send a event and leave the room
- now both users will be available again to join with any other random user, so mark and keep their status to create next rooms
